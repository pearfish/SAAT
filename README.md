SAAT
====

if you want to run the server, 
1) make sure you have node installed
2) open up cmd or node's command prompt, navigate to SAAT/
3) >npm install
  - npm will look at package.json for dependencies, then install those modules automatically
4) then to run server, > node server.js, or just clicky start.bat for laziness(will do the same thing)
